# CliqueTreeConstruction
UCR CS227 final project (2018 Spring)

This project focuses on two clique tree construction algorithms that are introduced in the textbook. The first algorithm uses variable elimination to build a clique tree. The other is using chordal graph to build a clique tree. I use C++ to implement these two algorithms and build some test cases to analysis the performance of these two algorithms.

I use two methods:
1. Variable Elimination

2. Chordal Graph
 2.1. Generate moral graph from Bayesian Network.
 2.2. Do heuristic triangulation from variable elimination.
 2.3. Generate maximal cliques from maximum cardinality search algorithm.
 2.4. Construct a clique tree from maximum spanning tree algorithm.
